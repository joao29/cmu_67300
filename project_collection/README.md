The simple Wikipedia collection used in this course can be found in the zipped files (swcollection.zip).
You just need to unzip it in your computer.


In case you want to know how this collection was created, check out the parser.py script.
You will need to download a dump file from wikipedia. For this course, we are using this one here:
